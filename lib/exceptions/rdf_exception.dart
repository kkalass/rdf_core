/// RDF Exception Framework
///
/// Provides a comprehensive exception hierarchy for RDF processing, enabling detailed error reporting
/// with source location information for debugging and robust error handling.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:rdf_core/exceptions/rdf_exception.dart';
/// try {
///   // some RDF operation
/// } catch (e) {
///   if (e is RdfException) print(e);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See also: [Dart Exception Guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/library-tour#exceptions)
library rdf_core.exceptions.base;

/// Base exception class for all RDF-related errors.
///
/// This serves as the root of the exception hierarchy for the RDF library,
/// providing common functionality for all specific exceptions. It captures
/// essential error information including error messages, causes, and source
/// locations.
///
/// Specific exception types in the library extend this base class to provide
/// more targeted error handling for different RDF operations (parsing,
/// serialization, validation, etc.).
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// try {
///   // RDF operation that might fail
/// } catch (e) {
///   if (e is RdfException) {
///     // Handle RDF-specific error with access to detailed information
///     print(e.message);
///     print(e.source);
///   } else {
///     // Handle other types of errors
///   }
/// }
/// ```
