/// RDF Validation Exception Hierarchy
///
/// Defines exceptions for RDF data validation, allowing applications to handle cases where RDF data
/// does not conform to expected constraints or data models. Focuses on semantic errors and structure issues.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:rdf_core/exceptions/rdf_validation_exception.dart';
/// try {
///   // validate RDF graph
/// } catch (e) {
///   if (e is RdfValidationException) print(e);
/// }
/// ```

/// Base exception class for all RDF validation-related errors
///
/// This class serves as the parent for all validation-specific exceptions,
/// covering issues where RDF data is syntactically valid but semantically
/// problematic according to some validation rules or constraints.
///
/// Validation may include checking against RDFS/OWL schemas, SHACL shapes,
/// application-specific constraints, or other semantic rules for RDF data.
class RdfValidationException extends RdfException {
  /// Creates a new RDF validation exception
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [message]: Required description of the validation error
  /// - [cause]: Optional underlying cause of this exception
  /// - [source]: Optional location information where the error was detected

/// Exception thrown when an RDF model constraint is violated
///
/// This exception indicates that the RDF data violates a specific constraint
/// defined in a data model, schema, or application logic. These are semantic errors
/// where the data is syntactically valid but doesn't comply with higher-level rules.
///
/// Examples include:
/// - Cardinality violations (e.g., missing a required property)
/// - Value range violations (e.g., numeric value out of allowed range)
/// - Pattern constraints (e.g., string not matching a required pattern)
/// - Graph structure constraints (e.g., missing a required relationship)

  /// - [message]: Required description of how the constraint was violated

/// Exception thrown when there's a type error in RDF data
///
/// This exception indicates that a value in the RDF data doesn't match
/// the expected type according to a schema, ontology, or application logic.
/// Type errors are a common subset of constraint violations that deal specifically
/// with datatype mismatches.
///
/// Examples include:
/// - A literal with the wrong XSD datatype
/// - A resource that doesn't conform to its expected class
/// - A value that can't be properly interpreted as the required type
