The onboarding should be dead simple and must not scare users away.

Some thoughts:

Connect to Solid, with a drop-down list of popular providers/issuers (solid.community, solid.podiumapp.com, etc.) - or even just buttons? definitely must also allow input of any URL.

For people new to solid: do not overwhelm with choices, but make it simple and choose a widely used default (ideally: based on users location)

In general: Should we make the list of popular providers dynamic and fetch it from a central registry, taking the user's location into account?

Anyways, for starters I only want one input box and a button.
